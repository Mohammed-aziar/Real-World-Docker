This README.md is simple and concise, but it contains all of the essential information for someone who clones your project to get it running.

Here are some additional items that you can add to your README.md:

* Instructions for testing the application
* Instructions for deploying the application in production
* Information about the project's dependencies
* Information about the project's license

You can also add additional sections to provide more detail about the individual services in your application.

For example, you could add a section for each service to describe its features, requirements, and usage instructions.
